### P.S

* Bot was made for Crackpixel under previous ownership.
* Made public cause showing off mid code and chaos
* One of my largest projects ever

## Credits

* CoreBot - basically cloning corebot i think
* Reconlx - Base structures and command handling.
* Dobro - command options and some part of handling
